An advanced AI Assistant developed with **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **Python 3.12** to revolutionize risk assessment and mitigation in the banking sector. This project leverages Generative AI to provide real-time, intelligent support for bankers.

## üìñ About The Project

Traditional risk assessment and mitigation in banking are often slow, labor-intensive, and costly. This project addresses these challenges by creating a powerful **AI Assistant** that acts as a specialized financial expert.

By fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on specialized financial datasets, the assistant provides bankers with highly accurate, consistent, and on-demand support for critical risk management tasks. The goal is to enhance decision-making, improve efficiency, and strengthen the bank's risk management framework.

### Key Features üéØ

  * **Real-time Fraud Detection:** Identify and flag fraudulent transactions as they happen.
  * **Credit Risk Early Warning:** Proactively detect early signs of credit default risk.
  * **Risk Mitigation Suggestions:** Provide actionable recommendations to mitigate identified risks.
  * **Human-like Interaction:** A user-friendly chat interface for seamless interaction.

-----

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is built using a modern, powerful stack designed for building state-of-the-art AI applications:

  * **Backend:** Python 3.12
  * **AI Orchestration:** LangChain & LangGraph
  * **Generative AI Models:**
      * **Commercial:** Gemini 2.5
      * **Open Source:** Llama 3 (or Qwen3)
  * **Baseline ML Models:** Logistic Regression, XGBoost, K-means
  * **Frontend:** Prototyped with a simple ChatGPT-like interface.

## üî¨ Methodology & Objectives

The research aims to design, build, and benchmark a Generative AI assistant against traditional machine learning approaches.

### Datasets

Both the GenAI and traditional models are trained and evaluated on the same standardized datasets:

1.  [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection)
2.  [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk)
3.  [Lending Club Loan Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club)

### Research Objectives

1.  **Design & Implement AI Assistant:** Design a robust system architecture and implement an AI Agent using fine-tuned **Gemini 2.5** and **Llama 3** models.
2.  **Establish Baselines:** Train traditional ML models (**Logistic Regression, XGBoost, K-means**) on the same datasets to create performance baselines for speed, latency, and accuracy.
3.  **Develop Prototype UI:** Build a simple, interactive chat interface to allow bankers to communicate with the AI assistant.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.12 or later
  * Pip package manager
  * An API key for the Gemini model

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```

### Usage

Launch the application by running the main script. This will start the chat interface where you can begin interacting with the AI Assistant.

```sh
python main.py
```
